## 📖 High-Level Overview

**This repository contains a mathematical inference engine built to solve a classic "Inverse Problem": How do you reconstruct a complex population when you only have aggregate data?**

While the application is biochemical (Heparan Sulfate), the underlying mathematics—**Constrained Optimization** and **Linear Programming**—are universally applicable to problems in Supply Chain, Inventory Management, and Population Statistics.

### The General Problem
Imagine a "Black Box" population containing millions of distinct items (species, customer types, or inventory SKUs).
* You cannot count every single item individually.
* You **can** take aggregate measurements (weighted sums, totals, averages).

**The Challenge:** How do you determine the composition of the population using *only* those aggregates?

### The Solution
This package implements a rigorous statistical framework to solve this by:
1.  **Setting Bounds (Linear Programming):** Even if you can't pinpoint the exact count of an item, the constraints allow you to mathematically prove the *minimum* and *maximum* possible values.
2.  **Most Likely Estimate (Maximum Entropy):** It calculates the "least biased" composition of the mixture that satisfies all observed constraints.

## 🔬 Scientific Context
This work reproduces the mathematical modeling described in the peer-reviewed publication:
> **"Combining measurements to estimate properties and characterization extent of complex biochemical mixtures; applications to Heparan Sulfate."** > *Scientific Reports* 6, 24829 (2016). [DOI: 10.1038/srep24829](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep24829)

### The Specific Application
The "Mixture" in this case is **Heparan Sulfate (HS)**—a complex chain of sugars with over **2 million possible variations** (molecular species).
* By applying **23 experimental constraints** (measurements), this package demonstrates that we can mathematically "characterize" the mixture, identifying non-random patterns (sulfation blocks) without needing to sequence every single molecule.
* It proves that a small set of well-chosen aggregate metrics can significantly reduce uncertainty about a massive population.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 11 or higher
- R (with `rJava`, `ggplot2`, and `patchwork` packages)
- Maven (for building from source)

### Installation
Clone the repository and build the JAR with dependencies:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/JoelRMath/heparan-sulfate.git](https://github.com/JoelRMath/heparan-sulfate.git)
cd heparan-sulfate
mvn clean package
```
The resulting JAR will be located in the target/ directory and can be called directly from R as demonstrated in the Figure Examples.
